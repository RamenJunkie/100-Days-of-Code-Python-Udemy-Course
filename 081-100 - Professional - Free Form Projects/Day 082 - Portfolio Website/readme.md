# Portfolio Website Project

Where is it?  No Code?

So, I considered polishing up my Github Pages site, which I will probably do eventually, because it would be keeping in line with the course.  Since we developed that during the course.  Then it sort of dawned on me, that a Github pages page, has basically nothing to do with Python, it's all HTML, and I already have a "Website to show off my work".

[My Blog](https://bloggingintensifies.com/) and this Github Profile.
