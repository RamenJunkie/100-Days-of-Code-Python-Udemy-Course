## Tinder Auto Swiper

So, I am really not in the market to use Tinder at all.  I was going to just skip this one.

Then I decided, "You know what, I can make a fake profile with a "https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com/" profile.

But then it seems dumb to get people to match with a bot.

No wait, I can set up the bot to Reject everyone, swipe, whatever direction "reject" is.  No matches!

Oh, it needs a lot in via Google, Facebook, or Phone Number.  Nevermind.

No wait, I have some olf Facebook Profiles for a couple of my cats, I will just use one of those to log in with!

Oh, it still wants a phone number.

So anyway, I decided even trying to fake it was not worth the trouble.
